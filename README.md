# Triplet-Attention-Teacher-Student-Framework
Enhanced Pavement Crack Segmentation with Minimal Labeled Data: A Triplet Attention Teacher-Student Framework

Our approach effectively learns from a small set of labeled samples, minimizing the need for extensive data. The Unet architecture ensures efficient high-level feature extraction, while the triplet attention mechanism improves the refinement of model weights and enhances feature extraction, especially for indistinct crack edges. The framework combines supervised loss and uncertainty loss to train the student model, with the teacher model leveraging the exponential moving average weights of the student model. Additionally, data augmentation and input noise enhance the robustness of the framework.
