Enhanced Pavement Crack Segmentation with Minimal Labeled Data: A Triplet Attention Teacher-Student Framework


Datasets
Concrete Crack Segmentation Dataset:
Concrete dataset comprises a total of 3,616 images, each sized 4032 by 33024 pixels. Among these, 1,744 images, along with their corresponding ground truth, were derived. This subset includes 458 high-resolution images of concrete surfaces captured at Middle East Technical University
